## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

* Moved `set_api_key` into a `dontrun` block to avoid exectution during the checks as suggested by the maintainers.

## Test environments
* local ubuntu 17.10, R 3.4.4
* ubuntu 14.04 (on travis-ci), R 3.5.0
* win-builder (devel and release)

## R CMD check results
There were no ERRORs, WARNINGs or NOTEs
